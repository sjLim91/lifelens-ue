# LifeLens Team Board

이 파일은 **ownership / active locks / Integration Requests**만 기록한다. 진행 상태는 `tasks/WORK_STATE.md`, 큰 순서는 `docs/DEVELOPMENT_MILESTONES.md`, 대화로 확정된 지속적 판단은 `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`를 따른다.

## Ownership

| Lane | Owner | Default scope |
|---|---|---|
| Core / AI / Simulation / World / Save / Bridge | Jjun | `Source/LifeLensCore/**`, `Source/LifeLens/AI/**`, `Source/LifeLens/Simulation/**`, `Source/LifeLens/World/**` |
| Build / CI / Android / Config integration | Jjun | `.github/workflows/**`, build pipeline, `Config/**`, startup/default map, project plugin integration |
| UI / Observer presentation | Dagyeom | `Source/LifeLens/UI/**`, `Content/UI/**` |
| Character presentation | Dagyeom | `Source/LifeLens/Characters/**`, `Content/Characters/**` |
| Environment / maps / world presentation | Dagyeom | `Source/LifeLens/WorldPresentation/**`, `Content/Environment/**`, `Content/Maps/**`, `Content/WorldPresentation/**` |

Authority rule: Core/World owns simulation truth. UI/Character/Environment/WorldPresentation presents it and must not duplicate authority.

## Current Assist Locks

**0 active locks.**

Jjun helping Dagyeom defaults to REVIEW_ONLY. Do not direct-push `dagyeom/*`; use assist branch/PR when a real cross-owner code change is required.

## Open Integration Requests

### IR-B — character facing / backwards-walk issue — REOPENED
- requester: Jjun / visual QA.
- needed owner: Dagyeom — Character presentation.
- current PIE evidence on 2026-09-15 reproduces the issue: residents translate toward the correct destination but the visual character body faces the opposite direction while walking.
- exact owner path: `Source/LifeLens/Characters/LLResidentMotionComponent.{h,cpp}`.
- Core/World movement is not currently suspected: `LLResidentCharacter::Tick()` moves toward the target and sets actor yaw from the travel delta.
- primary suspect: `MeshForwardYawOffsetDegrees = 90.0f` added during the earlier facing fix. Re-validate the imported Quaternius forward axis against the actual PIE mesh; an A/B check with `-90.0f` is the first targeted test, not a blind permanent change.
- verify after any fix: forward walking direction, stationary facing toward use/social targets, male/female/outfit variants, and no sideways-walk regression.
- do not change Core movement authority to compensate for an asset/presentation axis mismatch.
- status: BLOCKING visual correctness; not a Core simulation blocker.

## Recently resolved Integration Requests

### IR-A — WorldPresentation owner path — RESOLVED
- `Source/LifeLens/WorldPresentation/**` established as Dagyeom-owned presentation path.
- World Visual implementation merged in PR #90.
- presentation consumes authoritative read contracts only.

### IR-C — production map + observer framing — RESOLVED
- production map `/Game/Maps/LifeLensWorld` supplied by Dagyeom lane.
- default/startup map and observer camera integration completed in PR #96.
- #96 product head `2642e72efbc69a01c5f58cff08683b1cea793087` passed Preflight #551 and Unreal Linux Compile #103.
- squash merge: `60432fd102fed327d9e7ae8b4c3ad8727aff476c`.
- remaining camera/aesthetic confirmation is visual QA, not an open Integration Request.

## Integration Request rule

Open a new request only when one owner actually needs another owner to change a file/API/config outside the requester's lane.

A request must contain:
- requester / needed owner.
- exact file/API/config needed.
- why the existing contract is insufficient.
- target branch/PR or asset path.
- whether it blocks the current milestone.

Shared/Config change alone does **not** mechanically require Dagyeom review. Request review when the change materially touches Dagyeom-owned behavior, a cross-owner interface/contract, or genuinely needs visual/content validation.
